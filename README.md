# Conway's Game of Life

My implementation of Conway's Game Of Life using Python. This implementation has some basic functionalities that allow you to interact with the cells.

## Functionalities

* Play - Resumes activity of all cells
* Pause - Pauses activity of all cells
* Step - All cells enter next state in their lifecycle based on Conway logic
* Click - Click on screen to add more cells (Better to do this when game is paused)
